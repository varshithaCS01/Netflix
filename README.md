 **Abstract**

This project presents a Python-based task management system developed using Jupyter Notebook. The aim is to organize daily tasks into two distinct categories: completed and incomplete tasks. It facilitates efficient time management and tracking by providing a structured method to input, update, and categorize tasks. This system allows either user-defined inputs or operates on a predefined task list, offering flexibility. The modular design and clarity of implementation make it a suitable tool for students and professionals seeking better daily task tracking and productivity analysis.

1. **Introduction**

Time management and productivity are critical in both academic and professional environments. To address these challenges, this project introduces a simple yet effective Python-based solution that organizes tasks into completed and incomplete categories. Implemented within a Jupyter Notebook, the system promotes daily task tracking using basic control structures and user interaction.


2. **Objectives**

* To create a simple Python program that accepts and processes daily tasks.
* To categorize tasks based on user feedback into "completed" or "incomplete".
* To enhance productivity by offering a visual, editable, and repeatable structure for task planning.



3. **Methodology**

3.1 Environment

* **Language Used**: Python 3
* **IDE**: Jupyter Notebook
* **Libraries**: None (standard Python features used)

3.2 Task Flow

1. Initialize a task list (either via user input or a fixed list).
2. Display tasks to the user.
3. Accept input from the user indicating which tasks were completed.
4. Categorize and display results as:

   * Completed Tasks
   * Incomplete Tasks

3.3 Implementation Details

* Used conditional (`if-else`) statements to segregate tasks.
* Loops are used to iterate through task lists.
* Lists are used to store `checklist`, `completed_tasks`, and `incomplete_tasks`.



4. **Results**

* Tasks are successfully categorized.
* Dynamic input allows the program to adjust to different task lists.
* Clear output makes it easy for users to review their productivity.



5. **Conclusion**

The project provides a foundational framework for personal task management using Python. It showcases how simple logic and user interaction can effectively improve daily productivity. Future improvements can include GUI development using Tkinter or web-based interfaces using Flask or Django.


6. **Future Work**

* Integration with calendars or reminders.
* Visualization using graphs (e.g., pie chart of completed vs. incomplete).
* Export task history to CSV or Excel.
* Use of machine learning to predict task completion probability.
